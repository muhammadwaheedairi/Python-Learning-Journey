# 🪪 Simple Certificate Generator

This is a beginner-friendly Python script that generates a styled **Certificate of Completion** based on user input. It collects the student's name, course name, and completion date, then prints a neat certificate format on the terminal. A small touch of personalization is added by showing the name length at the end!

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helps practice and reinforce key beginner-level Python concepts:

- `input()` function for user input
- String methods: `.strip()`, `.title()`, `.upper()`, `.center()`, `.replace()`
- String formatting with `f-strings`
- Printing formatted outputs using alignment and repetition

---

## 🧩 Features

- 📝 Takes user's name, course title, and date as input
- 📜 Displays a clean and centered certificate using simple formatting
- 🔢 Calculates and shows total letters in the student’s name
- 💡 Great starting project for understanding user interaction in Python

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Prompts the user to enter:
   - Student's full name
   - Course title
   - Completion date
2. Uses string formatting and centering to create a certificate-like layout
3. Strips unnecessary whitespace and formats names properly
4. Calculates the number of letters in the name (ignores spaces)
