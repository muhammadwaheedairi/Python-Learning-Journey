# 🚀 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository!  
This repo is a personal log of my progress as I learn Python by building small, real-world projects and practicing core programming concepts.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Document my step-by-step learning journey.
- Practice Python concepts through mini-projects.
- Build a portfolio of beginner-level Python work.
- Stay consistent and organized while learning.

## 📁 What's Inside?

- Each folder represents a topic or project I've worked on.
- Every project includes clean, beginner-friendly code.
- A `README.md` is included in each folder to explain what the project does and what concepts it covers.

## 🛠️ Tools & Language

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Editor:** VS Code / Jupyter Notebook  
- **Platform:** GitHub for version control and project tracking

## 🌱 My Learning Approach

I’m learning Python from the ground up — starting from basic syntax, input/output, typecasting, and strings, and gradually moving toward real-world logic building and project development. No frameworks or libraries are used (unless necessary) — just pure Python to build a strong foundation.
